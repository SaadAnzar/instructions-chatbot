        This is a brief introduction on how to use ChatGPT, a product created by
        OpenAI that is driven by a large language model. If some of those terms
        are unfamiliar, please review the glossary in Part 1: AI Starter. We are
        using ChatGPT as an example, but the following information applies to
        other large language models, such as those developed by Microsoft, Meta,
        Google, Anthropic, and others. This is not an endorsement of ChatGPT
        over the others. Future tutorials will cover image generation, code, and
        more.
